        <p>The T-34-85, a Soviet medium tank introduced during World War II, remains renowned for its exceptional balance of firepower, mobility, and ruggedness. Its designation, "T-34-85," signifies an upgrade from its predecessor, the T-34, with the introduction of an 85mm main gun. This upgrade significantly enhanced its anti-tank capabilities, allowing it to engage and destroy heavier German tanks with greater ease. With sloped armor providing decent protection and a robust diesel engine powering its mobility, the T-34-85 proved highly effective in maneuver warfare, capable of swiftly outmaneuvering and outgunning its adversaries. Its relatively simple construction and ease of mass production contributed to its widespread deployment across the Eastern Front, where it played a crucial role in turning the tide against Nazi Germany. Beyond its wartime exploits, the T-34-85 continued to serve in various conflicts around the globe, showcasing its enduring legacy as one of the most iconic and influential tanks of the 20th century.</p>
        <p>This paticular modle of T34 was a Post war Production model meaning it is built to a higher standard than war production variants, and features hardware not available to tankers during the war</p>
